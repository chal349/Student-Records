This application is built around parsing and manipulating data from an input string, and storing them in objects.
-----------------------------------

There are 2 classes in the project-

Student class
  Defines Student objects
  Stores variable data
  Functions that return data, as well as modify data

Roster class
  Parses data from a string
  Creates an array of pointers to Student objects
  Modifies data in the Student objects
  Ability to make calculations using Student object's data members and output results
  
  ---------------------------------

The main function demonstrates the program's ability to use its functions, and outputs data in a legible format.
